# SQL Advanced Certification

This repository contains my work from the SQL Advanced Certification program I completed at the London Academy of IT. The program provided in-depth knowledge and practical experience in advanced SQL concepts and techniques.

## Course Content

The SQL Advanced Certification program covered the following topics:

- Date and Time Functions: Demonstrates the usage of date and time functions to perform calculations and manipulate date/time data in SQL queries.

- Subqueries: Explores the concept of subqueries, nested queries within queries, and their various applications in combining and filtering data.

- IN and NOT IN Operators: Covers the usage of the IN and NOT IN operators to check for matches or non-matches in a subquery or a list of values.

- EXISTS and NOT EXISTS Operators: Discusses the EXISTS and NOT EXISTS operators used to check for the existence or non-existence of records in a subquery.

- JOIN Operations: Explains different types of join operations (INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN, CROSS JOIN) and their practical implementations in combining data from multiple tables.

- Aggregate Functions and GROUP BY Clause: Describes aggregate functions and the GROUP BY clause for calculating summary values and grouping data based on specific columns.

- GROUP BY CUBE and ROLLUP: Explores advanced grouping techniques using the GROUP BY CUBE and GROUP BY ROLLUP clauses to generate aggregated results for multiple combinations and hierarchies.

- Temporary Tables: Introduces the concept of temporary tables, their creation, usage, and benefits in storing and processing intermediate results within a session.

- Common Table Expressions (CTE): Demonstrates the use of CTEs, temporary result sets that can be referenced within a query, to simplify complex queries and improve code readability.

- Dynamic SQL: Covers the dynamic execution of SQL statements constructed at runtime, enabling flexibility and adaptability in query generation.

- Window Functions: Explores windowing functions, which perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, providing advanced analytical capabilities.

- T-SQL Programming: Introduces T-SQL programming concepts, including control flow statements (IF, WHILE), error handling (TRY-CATCH), and stored procedures.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organised as follows:

- `/examples`: Contains SQL code examples illustrating the implementation of various advanced SQL concepts discussed in the certification program.

- `/projects`: Includes hands-on queries completed as part of the certification program, showcasing practical applications of advanced SQL techniques.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the examples resources in this repository to deepen your understanding of advanced SQL concepts.
